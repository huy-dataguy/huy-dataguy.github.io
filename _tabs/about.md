# Hi there, I'm Nguyá»…n Quá»‘c Huy

ðŸŽ“ I'm a third-year Data Engineering student at HCMUTE (Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology and Education), Vietnam.  
I'm passionate about building scalable data pipelines, real-time streaming systems, and exploring modern Big Data technologies.

ðŸ”­ I focus on mastering Big Data technologies, data lakehouse and warehouse architectures, and real-time streaming, while also diving into full-stack development (MERN) to complement my Data Engineering skills.

## Featured Projects

- **[NYC-Taxi-Lakehouse](https://github.com/huy-dataguy/NYC-Taxi-Lakehouse)**  
Real-time Big Data Pipeline â€“ Spark Structured Streaming, Delta Lake, Trino, Airflow, Superset, MinIO
Built a modern lakehouse architecture to process and analyze NYC taxi trip data in near real-time.
Ingested raw trip data with Spark Structured Streaming, processed into Delta Lake with ACID support.
Queried data interactively using Trino, visualized insights via Apache Superset dashboards.
Apache Airflow orchestrated batch and stream workflows; MinIO served as a cloud-native object store.

- **[HadoopSphere](https://github.com/huy-dataguy/HadoopSphere)**  
Containerized Big Data Ecosystem â€“ Docker, Hadoop, Spark, Hive, Pig, HBase, Zookeeper
Deployed a full-fledged Hadoop ecosystem using Docker Compose, ideal for learning and demo purposes.
Integrated services: HDFS, Hive Metastore, Spark, Pig, HBase, and Zookeeper.
Enabled fast reproducibility and experimentation with Big Data tools in an isolated multi-container environment.

- **[Salus-Assistant](https://github.com/huy-dataguy/Salus-Assistant)**  
AI Assistant App â€“ MERN Stack + Gemini2
Developed an intelligent assistant web app combining full-stack and AI technologies, offering smart conversational interaction.
Frontend built with React for smooth UX; stores chat history and user context in MongoDB.
Demonstrates practical integration of AI into a MERN-based web system.

- **[MERN-Stack-Book-Store](https://github.com/huy-dataguy/MERN-Stack-Book-Store)**  
E-commerce Bookstore Platform â€“ React, Redux, Express.js, MongoDB
